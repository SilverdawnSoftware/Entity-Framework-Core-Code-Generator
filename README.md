# Entity Framework Core Code Generator 

This code generator allows you to map an UML class model to the Entity Framework Core framework.

All the code to access and preform updates to the database is created to. This also integrates with the the WebAPI Core to allow for REST access via the web of the database.

The code for this code generator is available at https://github.com/SilverdawnSoftware/SilverModel-Code-Generators/tree/master/Microsoft/Database/Entity%20Framework%20Core
